## Copied from Kickstartt.nvim with some personal configurations

This is also the first time doing a Markdown file with my blood, sweat and tears so... IDK.

There is a lot of stuff to do that I don't know about so. I'd dumb lol.

This has:

- [x] Everything in Kickstart, including the `Lazy.nvim` package manager.
- [x] I don't know the rest because I forgot.
- [ ] Do I know what I am doing?

## What I am working on right now?

I am currently doing Lua so I can understand what I am doing, also LSP does not work on my end, likely as a result of using an ARM based computer.
